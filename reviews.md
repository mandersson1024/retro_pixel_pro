★★★★★ **Great asset and super-responsive/helpful dev**

[Updated 16/01/2017] Dev responded and provided updated code fix to skip the resolution resize. 5 stars. Best dev on unity store.

[Old review] Camera issue fixed but if you use a flexible window size to preview your games in play mode you will get pixels of varying sizes or an anti-aliased effect or both as the asset requires to to enter the desired resolution manually, while unity doesn't always play in a fixed ratio/resolution. You can change unity's settings to only play in letterbox mode at a fixed resolution but this is not ideal and often you will want to have the play window docked with other windows visible. The description of Retro Pixel Pro states that users can maintain a high resolution and "only reduce the color palette for a posterization-like effect." but I cannot find a way to disable the resolution changes and only modify the colors alone. It does work perfectly when you manually set the play mode to 720p and also manually set RPP to 720p but this makes it difficult to test at varying resolutions or to simply fill the screen. Being able to manually set the resolution is a good thing when it comes to optimization as if your game is playing at 2x zoom you can then tell RPP to only sample 1/4 of the pixels, but for testing and prototyping it would be nice to be able to set this to auto or off. As this is more of a convenience issue I believe it is still worth 4 stars and it still works far better than the competing product: Resolutioner (which isn't even fully compatible with the other company's other products), but if there's a way to keep the existing resolution unchanged and only reduce the color palette as in the description then it will be 5 stars from me.

[Old old review] It works unless your camera is instantiated at runtime.

★★★★★ **100% accurate**
<br>
Nice, though, would be nice if Pro version had 256 colors settled as default.

★★★★★ **Exactly what I was hoping for**
<br>
This is an excellent shader. Had some issues (errors on my part) at first but the author was extremely helpful in troubleshooting and now it works like a charm. Definitely worth the purchase for so much versatility!

★★★★☆ **Very nice, very easy**
<br>
I was working on retro style graphics with rendered textures and such, when I stumbled upon the demo for this. It did exactly what I needed, more efficiently, and very easily. I haven't tried it on mobile yet, but apparently it won't work very well. That's unfortunate, but I'm still glad to have it of my other platforms.
