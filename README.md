Retro Pixel Pro was a fullscreen image effect that was sold on the Unity Asset Store between November 2015 and May 2019.

It reduced the number of colors by mapping the input to a colormap in a fragmet shader. Optionally also reduced the pixel resolution of the input image. The colormap was customizable in the inspector, and a number of preset palettes were included and also the option to extract a palette from an image.
