Retro Pixel Pro is a fullscreen image effect for Unity that was sold on the Unity Asset Store from November 2015 until it was deprecated in May 2020, after the introduction of Unity's new render pipeline system.

It reduced the number of colors by mapping the input image to a colormap in a fragmet shader. Optionally, it also reduced the pixel resolution. The colormap was customizable in the inspector, and a number of preset palettes were included as well as the option to extract a palette from an image.

#### Notable stats
* Sold in 252 copies, grossing $2890
* The average review score was 4.9 out of 5. Here are the [reviews](reviews.md).
* Selected as Staff Pick on the Asset Store in July of 2016
